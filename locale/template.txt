In the TA3 age, oil (petroleum) serves as an almost infinite fuel. But oil is difficult and expensive to recover:@n1: Search for oil with the TA3 Oil Explorer@n2: Drill for oil with the TA3 Oil Drill Box (oil derrick)@n3: Recover the oil with the TA3 Oil Pumpjack@n4: A power station nearby provides the necessary @n	 electrical power for the derrick and pumpjack.@n5: Tubes or rails are used for oil transportation.=
Iron Age is the first level of the available four technic stages.@nThe goal of TA1 is to collect and craft enough Iron Ingots@nto be able to build machines for stage 2 (TA2).@n1. You have to collect dirt and wood to build a Coal Pile.@n    (The Coal Pile is needed to produce charcoal)@n2. Build a Coal Burner to melt iron to iron ingots.@n3. Craft a Gravel Sieve and collect gravel.@n    (A Hammer can be used to smash cobble to gravel)@n4. Sieve the gravel to get the necessary ores or go mining.=

The Distributor works as filter and pusher. It allows to divide and distribute incoming items into the 4 output ports. The channels can be switched on/off and individually configured with up to 6 item types. The filter passes the configured items and restrains all others. Unconfigured but activated filters are used for items, which do not fit to all other filters. If the Distributor canâ€™t push an item into a block with an inventory (such as a chest) because that inventory is full, but there is one open and unconfigured output, it will use this output port.=
The End Wrench is a tool to read any kind od status information from a node with command inderface.@n- use (left mouse button) = read status@n- place (right mouse button) = send command: on/off=
The Forceload Block keeps the corresponding area loaded and the machines operational as far as the player is logged in. If the player leaves the game, all areas will be unloaded.@nThe maximum number of Forceload Blocks per player is configurable (default 16).@nThe loaded area per block is a cube with 16 m side length (according to a Minetest area block). Punching the block makes the area visible and invisible again.=
The Grinder grinds all kinds of cobblestone to gravel, gravel to sand, sand to clay, wood to leaves, and more.@nIt can grind one item every four seconds.@nIt needs 4 units axle power.=

The Oil Age is the third level of the available technic stages. The goal of TA3 is to build Power Stations, drill for oil, and build machines to produce ores and chips for smart TA4 devices and machines.=
The Protected Chest is useful in protected areas (by means of any protection mod).@nOnly players with interaction rights on that position can take/put item from/to the chest.=
The Protected Chest is useful in protected areas (by means of any protection mod).@nOnly players with interaction rights on that position can take/put item from/to the chest.@nThe Chest supports commands to read the last player action (player-name, take/put, item-name) and the chest state ('empty', 'loaded', 'full').@nThe chest returns 'loaded' when it is not empty and not full, 'full' is returned, when no empty stack is available.@n=
The Pumpjack works similar to a pusher. It pumps one oil item every 8 seconds. It needs 16 units of electrical power.=
The Pusher is a pulling/pushing block, moving items from one inventory block to another (e.g. chests). Start the Pusher with a right-click. It shows the state 'running' as infotext. The Pusher moves items from left to right (IN to OUT).@nIf the source chest is empty, the Pusher goes into 'standby' state for some seconds. If the destination chest is full, the Pusher goes into 'blocked' state.@nThe TA2 Pusher moves two items every 2 seconds.=

The Techage Black Hole Block let items disappear. If your machine produces to much or unneeded items, push them into the Black Hole.=
The box automatically unfolds to a derrick when you press the button.@n1: Place the box in the middle of the marked position@n    (the derrick requires a free area of 3x3m)@n2: Press the build button@n3: Supply the drill with electricity@n4: Supply the drill with Drill Bits@n5: Press the start button@n6: Remove the excavated material with Tubes/Pusher@n7: The drill stops when oil is found@n    (drill speed is 1m/16s)@n8: Replace the drill with the Pumpjack.@nIt needs 16 units electrical power=

Used to find oil (petroleum). Oil can be used as fuel for the Power Station and others. Place the block and right-click on the block to explore the underground. The block will explore a 16x16 field with a depth of up to 400 m. To search deeper, click the block several times. When oil is found, the position for the derrick (Drill Box) is highlighted.@nHint: Mark and protect the position for later use.=

Used to produce WLAN Chips, needed for TA4 machines.@nThe fab produces 1 item every 6 seconds.@nIt needs 12 units electrical power.=
Used to store electrical energy. Charged in about 10 min, provides energy for 10 min.@nIt take and deliver up to 10 units electrical power.=
Used to wash Sieved Gravel to get Usmium Nuggets. The block has to be placed under flowing water. The washed-out nuggets must be sucked in with a Hopper.@nFor the plant you need a chest, the Hopper, the Rinser with tube support and a frame around the flowing water (see plan).@nHint: You can test the Rinser with some sticks that are washed out immediately.@nIt needs 3 units axle power=

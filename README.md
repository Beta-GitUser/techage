# Tech Age [techage] (Minetest 5.0+)

Tech Age, a mod to go through 4 tech ages in search of wealth and power.

**Tech Age (techage) is the successor to TechPack V2, at first glance similar and yet completely different!**

Important facts:
- techage is not backwards compatible and cannot be installed on a server together with TechPack
- techage is significantly more extensive, since additional mods are integrated
- techage represents 4 technological ages:
  - Iron Age (TA1) - simple tools like coal pile, coal burner, gravel sieve, hammer for getting ores and making goods
  - Steam Age (TA2) - Simple machines that are powered by steam engines and drive axles
  - Oil Age (TA3) - More modern machines that are powered by electricity.  
   The electricity is generated by coal & oil power plants. The oil must be explored, extracted and transported.
  - Future Age (TA4) - Electricity from renewable energy sources such as sun and wind.  
   Environmentally friendly electricity storage, intelligent machines and means of transport of the future
- Since the levels build on each other, all ages have to be run through one after the other

In contrast to TechPack, the resources are more limited and it is much more difficult to pass all levels.
(no endless ore generation by means of cobble generators)
